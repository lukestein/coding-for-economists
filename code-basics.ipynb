    "# Basics of Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn about the basics of objects, types, operations, conditions, loops, functions, and imports. These are the basic building blocks of almost all programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has benefited from the excellent [*Python Programming for Data Science*](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/README.html) book by Tomas Beuzen.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "Remember, you can launch this page interactively by using the 'Colab' or 'Binder' buttons under the rocket symbol at the top of the page. You can also download this page as a Jupyter Notebook to run on your own computer: use the 'download .ipynb' button under the download symbol the top of the page.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you get stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth saying at the outset that, *no-one*, and I mean no-one, memorises half of the stuff you'll see in this book. 80% or more of time spent programming is actually time spent looking up how to do this or that online, 'debugging' a code for errors, or testing code. This applies to all programmers, regardless of level. You are here to learn the skills and concepts of programming, not the precise syntax (which is easy to look up later).\n",
    "\n",
    "![xkcd-what-did-you-see](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how to Google is one of the most important skills of any coder. No-one remembers every function from every library. Here are some useful coding resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- when you have an error, look on Stack Overflow to see if anyone else had the same error (they probably did) and how they overcame it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if you're having trouble navigating a new package or library, look up the documentation online. The best libraries put as much effort into documentation as they do the code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "- use cheat sheets to get on top of a range of functionality quickly. For instance, this excellent (mostly) base Python [Cheat Sheet](https://gto76.github.io/python-cheatsheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- if you're having a coding issue, take a walk to think about the problem, or explain your problem to an animal toy on your desk ([traditionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) a rubber duck, but other animals are available).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values, variables, and types\n",
    "\n",
    "A value is datum such as a number or text. There are different types of values: 352.3 is known as a float or double, 22 is an integer, and \"Hello World!\" is a string. A variable is a name that refers to a value: you can think of a variable as a box that has a value, or multiple values, packed inside it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost any word can be a variable name as long as it starts with a letter or an underscore, although there are some special keywords that can't be used because they already have a role in the Python language: these include `if`, `while`, `class`, and `lambda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a variable in Python is achieved via an assignment (putting a value in the box), and this assignment is done via the `=` operator. The box, or variable, goes on the left while the value we wish to store appears on the right. It's simpler than it sounds:"

In subsequent chapters, we'll see how to combine the elements here to do productive analysis in economics."
