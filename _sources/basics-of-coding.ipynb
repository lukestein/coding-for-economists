This applies to all programmers, regardless of level. You are here to learn the skills and concepts of programming, not the precise syntax (which is easy to look up later).\n",

    "## Best practices for coding\n",
    "\n",
    "The validity of your research depends, to a frightening degree, on the quality of your code. There are many ways to write code and, over the years, software developers have worked out best practices that help to make writing, using, debugging, and reading code more fun, and to make the end product higher quality. (There's nothing worse than wading through someone's terrible code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Code quality 2](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, you are going to be writing code for your co-authors or for future you. Following best practice will save you hours, and hours, and *hours* of time. You may think that by cutting out some of these practices that you'll save time. Well, it depends how heavily you discount your future time. Regardless of your discount rate, it's almost always worth it to follow best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately there's lot of great advice, and even tools, to help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Reproducibility is also an important part of coding best practice, but we'll talk about that in a later chapter. Likewise, I won't talk about a more advanced best practice, testing, here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code in style\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to think about is code style, ie how you write equivalent valid code. Python has a whole set of conventions about good style called ['PEP8'](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), which it's worth taking a quick look at. It includes advice like indentation should always be 4 spaces per level and to surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning all of these would be tedious beyond belief. The good news is that a combination of packages and Visual Studio Code will do almost all of them for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code can use a so-called 'linter' package to highlight any lines of your code that don't comply with PEP8. I use [**pycodestyle**](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/). Once you've installed it and set it up in Visual Studio Code (Command Palette -> Python: Set Linter) you select some of your code in a script and hit Command+K, Command+F on Mac (Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F otherwise) and pycodestyle will automatically fix what it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go even further than just linting and allow all of your code to be restyled more dramatically using a 'code formatter'. I sometimes use [**black**](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (you can have any code style you like, as long as it's black), which is very opinionated but great it you just want to forget about formatting your own code nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use **black**, install it according to the documentation. Then it runs from the command line, eg `black yourscript.py`. Here's an example of the kind of reformatting it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# in:\n",
    "\n",
    "def very_important_function(template: str, *variables, file: os.PathLike, engine: str, header: bool = True, debug: bool = False):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Applies `variables` to the `template` and writes to `file`.\"\"\"\n",
    "    with open(file, 'w') as f:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# out:\n",
    "\n",
    "def very_important_function(\n",
    "    template: str,\n",
    "    *variables,\n",
    "    file: os.PathLike,\n",
    "    engine: str,\n",
    "    header: bool = True,\n",
    "    debug: bool = False,\n",
    "):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Applies `variables` to the `template` and writes to `file`.\"\"\"\n",
    "    with open(file, \"w\") as f:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages have a style guide or at least some conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Code quality](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do not repeat yourself (DRY)\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRY principle is 'Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system.' Divide your code into re-usable pieces that you can call when and where you want. Don't write lengthy methods, but divide logic up into clearly differentiated chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This saves having to repeat code, having no idea whether it's this or that version of the same function doing the work, and will help your debugging efforts no end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the naming convention for almost all objects is lower case separated by underscores, e.g. ‘this_is_a_script.py’. This style of naming is also known as snake case. There are different naming conventions though--[Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst) made this fantastic cartoon of the different conventions that are in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Different naming conventions](http://aeturrell.github.io/home/images/in_that_case.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "But good naming isn't just about following the conventions, it's also about giving objects names that are clear and useful. Instead of calling a variable that measures incomes `variable_one`, call it `income_measure`. Instead of calling a function that inverts a matrix `matrix_stuff`, call it `matrix_invert`. The better named your variables, the clearer your code will be--and the fewer comments you will need to write!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Code comments, extra information that is not executed when the code is run, can be added by a preceding hash character `# This is a comment`. Use code comments to provide extra contextual information that *isn't* conveyed by function and variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code review\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform code reviews. Give what you’ve done to a colleague and ask them to go through it line-by-line checking it works as intended. If they do this properly and don’t find any mistakes or issues then I’d be very surprised. Return the favour to magically become a better coder yourself.\n",
    "\n",
